This is some python code using cuML-dask to solve a classification problem based on a kaggle data-set. 
In crontrast to the previous folder we are now splitting the work-load and utilizing multiple GPUs at the same time,

Techniques used:
- searching is data-set is installed and unpacked with os
- creating a local CUDA cluster with dask
- building dictionaries, which contain all file locations
- shrinking all images and some feature engineering with OpenCV
- loading cuML-dask libraries and defintion of a dictionary comprising all parameters to test and fit
- looping throught the dictionary and using GridSearchCV
