This is some python code using cuML to solve a classification problem based on a kaggle data-set.

Techniques used:
- searching is data-set is installed and unpacked with os
- building dictionaries, which contain all file locations
- shrinking all images and some feature engineering with OpenCV
- loading cuML libraries and defintion of a dictionary comprising all parameters to test and fit
- looping throught the dictionary and using GridSearchCV
