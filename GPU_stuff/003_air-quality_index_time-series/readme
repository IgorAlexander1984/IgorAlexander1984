First attempt to analyse time-series and to get familiar with TSA/TSF
This is some python code using cuML to solve a time-series forecasting problem based on a kaggle data-set.

Techniques used:
- combining the data files based on the location (state) to get a combines DataFrame
- some basic EDA, leading to the combination of the same metric with different units
- calculating the mean for erntries having the same date-time and removing NaN values
- calculation of a rolling average to remove spikes and subsequent outlier removal
- loading cuML libraries and definition of a dictionary comprising all parameters to test and fit
- looping throught the parameter-dictionary and using GridSearchCV
